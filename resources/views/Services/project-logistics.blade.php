                    <p>
                        Project logistics involves the planning, transportation, and management of
                        containers used for heavy, oversized, or complex cargo, which is essential in
                        large scale projects like power plants, oil and gas developments, and renewable
                        energy infrastructure. Selecting the right container type is critical due to the
                        cargo is size and shape. A thorough cargo survey helps determine accurate
                        dimensions and weight, and a detailed loading plan, including lashing and
                        blocking, is essential for safe transport. Special permits and documentation,
                        like Out of Gauge (OOG) declarations, are often required.

                        Multimodal transportation, combining trucks, ships, and trains, is typically
                        used to efficiently move such project cargo. Close coordination between the
                        technical and logistics teams ensures safety and operational efficiency
                        throughout the process. This requires careful planning of every aspect of the
                        transportation journey.
